# "Emergent phenomena in driven, non-equilibrium systems: a computational and theoretical study"

Working materials for my PhD thesis.

Reminder: I should frame my thesis as problem-based, not technique-based.
I want to show that I could use multiple different techniques to solve a specific problem.
In this thesis, the problem I'm looking to solve is that of explaining the emergent behavior we see in types of active matter systems.

__Current Timeline__: (working back from general timeline below)
* Feb 28, approx: Hold data meeting (or mtgs with individual committee members)
* Mar 31, approx: Submit form indicating where I was published
* Apr 6, approx (M): Pre-defense review with Rackham
* Apr 13 (M): Thesis due to commmittee
* Apr 24 (F): Confirm thesis reviews are in
* Apr 27 (M): Thesis defense

__Verbatim quotes from the [Dissertation handbook](https://rackham.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/oard-dissertation-handbook.pdf)__:
> Timeline: Approval of the Dissertation Topic: If the proposed dissertation research is essentially similar to an already passed Preliminary Examination research proposal, that one-page summary may be submitted as the dissertation topic proposal.

> The Doctoral Committee consists of at least four graduate faculty members, at least two of whom are from the Chemical Engineering Department, (including the faculty advisor, who serves as Chair of the Committee), and at least one of whom must be from outside the department (designated the “Outside Member”).

> A PhD student who is near the completion of his/her PhD research and is ready to start writing should hold a data meeting with his/her dissertation committee.

__General Timeline__:
* 2-3 mo before proposed defense: Data meeting, submit [data mtg form](https://che.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/03/Data-Meeting-Form.pdf) within one week
* 3 weeks before defense: Meet with Rackham Graduate School Office of Records and Dissertations (OARD) for pre-defense review [here](https://rackham.umich.edu/navigating-your-degree/completing-doctoral-degree-requirements/)
* 2 weeks before defense: Send thesis to committee members to read and review
* 3 days before defense: Confirm all committee members have submitted their thesis evaluations in Wolverine access; print and bring Oral Report form for committee members to sign at defense
* Before defense: Submit [form indicating where you were published](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxEiStIMKASaAH4BN511hrzVohTeAM1mI_hTdVLMTkcvvwTw/viewform)
