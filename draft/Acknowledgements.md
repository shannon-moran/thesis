# Acknowledgements

It's fitting that acknowledgements are the beginning of a thesis.
These folks are the foundation upon which the work that comprises these hundred or so pages is built.

First, thanks goes to my advisor, Professor Sharon Glotzer. When I visited Michigan when deciding whether to go to grad school, I was convinced I'd made a terrible mistake until I met you. Thank you for being an example of a creative, innovative, and impactful scientist.

One of the many things that has made my time at Michigan so special has been the support and community with faculty.
Professor Lola Eniola, I'm so grateful for your mentorship these last few years as we worked together on the Peer Mentorship program (Chaper X of this thesis). I learned a lot about working in academia, effecting change, and professional advancement from you. Thank you.
Professor Bob Ziff, I've so appreciated our chats about science, Ann Arbor, and life over the last few years.
To my thesis committee-- Sharon, Bob, and Professors Xiaoming Mao and Ron Larson-- thank you for taking the time to improve this work before it went into print.

Thanks is also due to mentors who helped get me to this point.
Professor Matt Helgeson, thanks for taking on an enthusiastic undergrad and showing me what research really looked like.
Dr. Adam Rothman, thanks for supporting me in going back for a doctorate post-BCG. I learned more from you about management, passion for work, and my own leadership style in our few years of working together than I have at any other point in my life.

My time graduate school has been blessed by outstanding "co-workers" I could not have gotten through this time without.
Will "Willy Z" Zygmunt, I'm thrilled to immortalize this nickname in this thesis for future generations. Thanks for keeping me laughing when I should have been working, for always being down for a walk and coffee, and for keeping me more grounded than I would have ever been without your friendship. As I've handed in my thesis before you: "marco".
Vyas Ramasubramani and Bradley Dice, how lucky I am to have worked with people whose company I so enjoy and who have been such technical role models for me. I'm a better computational scientist thanks to both of you.
Karen Coulter, among many more impactful things I should list here, thank you for giving me the push I needed to take up hockey. MACHRL was one of the great joys of my time in grad school.
Other colleagues-turned-friends, in alphabetical order-- Rosy Cersonsky Adorf, Simon Adorf, Jim Antonaglia, Julia Dschemuchadse, Chrisy Du, Erin Teich-- thank you keeping me laughing through this PhD process.

Thanks also goes to friends outside of the Glotzer lab who helped me keep an eye on the world outside of academia.
Kavita Chandra, thank you for assuring me that I would eventually finish this thing (and for being a great friend, etc etc).
Alison Banka, thanks for being my sounding board in grad school. I look forward to finding more chip dip recipes in common.
To the Stanford GSB Class of 2019, thanks for letting me crash your events for two years and pretend occasionally that I'd actually gone to business school instead. It was better for my mental health than I can say.

Finally, I would never have taken the step of coming to graduate school without the support of my family.
Mom and Dad, thank you for always enabling me to push myself, for loving me as I am, and showing me what it means to be a good person.
Louie and Colin, being your sister has been one of the greatest gifts of my life. When I think of family, it's our trio that I think of.
Last but not least-- Alice, none of this would have been possible without your unpaid labor as my editor-in-chief. What a gift it is to love and be loved by you.
