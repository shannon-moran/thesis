It's fitting that acknowledgements are the beginning of this thesis.
No one person should write a hundred or so pages on science without a few pairs of eyes.

First, to my advisor Sharon Glotzer-- when I visited Michigan when deciding whether to go to grad school, I was convinced I'd made a terrible mistake until I met you.
Thank you for being an example of a creative, innovative, and impactful scientist.
- Bob Ziff
- Xiaoming
- Ron Larson

My time graduate school has been blessed by outstanding "co-workers" I could not have gotten through this time without.
Will "Willy Z" Zygmunt, I'm thrilled to immortalize this nickname in this thesis for future generations.
Thanks for keeping me laughing when I should have been working, for always being down for a walk and coffee, and for keeping me more grounded than I would have ever been without your friendship.
Vyas Ramasubramani and Bradley Dice, how lucky I am to have worked with people whose company I so enjoy and who have been such technical role-models for me.
I'm a better computational scientist thanks to both of you.
Isaac Bruss, who was co-author on my first project in the Glotzer group.
Karen Coulter, among many more impactful things I should list here, thank you for giving me the push I needed to take up hockey.
Having a sport again as an adult has been an incredible valuable thing to have in my life.
Many other colleagues: Bryan Van Saders, Erin Teich, Chrisy Du, Julia Dschemuchadse, Jim Antonaglia, Rosy Cersonsky Adorf, Simon Adorf.

I would not have taken the step of coming to graduate school without the support of my family.
Mom and Dad, thank you for always enabling me to push myself, for loving me as I am, and showing me what it means to be a good person.
Louie and Colin, being your sister has been one of the greatest gifts of my life.
When I think of family, it's our trio that I think of.
Last but not least-- Alice, none of this would have been possible without your unpaid labor as my editor-in-chief.
Love you at least to the moon and back.
