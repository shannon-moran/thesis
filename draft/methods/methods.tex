An identical particle model was used for all studies in this thesis.

\section{Particle model}
take from active matter paper

\section{Disk model}
WRITE

\section{Dynamics and simulation methods}
take from active matter paper

\subsection{Brownian versus Langevin dynamics}
consider nixing

\section{Open source software use}
simulation: hoomd
analysis and visualization: freud, ovito, plato, rowan
data management: signac, garnett
other python: jupyter notebooks
